## üß™ Testing Guide

### 1. Get Your Auth Token

First, authenticate and get your session token:

```bash
# If you don't have a user, create one via guest endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/guest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"deviceId": "test-device-123"}'

# Save the token from response
TOKEN="your-session-token-here"
```

### 2. Test Friend Features

```bash
# Search for users
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/friends/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "user@example.com"}'

# Find user by friend code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/friends/find-by-code \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"friendCode": "abc123xyz"}'

# Send friend request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/friends/send-request \

  }'

# Get post details

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow

```
Client Request
    ‚Üì
API Route Handler (route.ts)

Auth Validation (requireAuth)
    ‚Üì
Utility Function (friend-utils/post-utils/feed-utils)
    ‚Üì
