# Social Features Implementation - Session Summary

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ~60% Complete - Core Infrastructure Ready

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Database Schema (100% Complete)

**Updated Models:**

- ✅ `User` - Added social fields (displayName, friendCode, bio, avatarUrl)

**New Models:**

- ✅ `RecipePost` - Status updates with text, photo, rating, review
- ✅ `PostLike` - Track post likes with unique constraint
- ✅ `PostComment` - Comments on posts
- ✅ `FeedActivity` - Track all activities (post, meal_plan, recipe_saved, friend_added)

**Migration:**

- ✅ Applied schema changes with `prisma db push`
- ✅ Populated friend codes for 6 existing users using cuid2
- ✅ All relations properly indexed

### 2. TypeScript Types (100% Complete)

Added to `lib/types.ts`:

- ✅ `UserBasic` - Minimal user info for social features
- ✅ `Friendship` - Full friendship type with friend data

- ✅ `RecipeBasic` - Minimal recipe info for feed
- ✅ `PostComment` - Comment with user data
- ✅ `FeedActivity` - Activity with polymorphic references

---

## 🔄 Remaining Work (40%)

### API Endpoints (16 files to create)

All templates are ready in `SOCIAL_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Just need to:

1. Create directory structure
2. Copy templates into route.ts files
3. Test endpoints

**Friend Management (7 endpoints):**

- `POST /api/friends/send-request` - Send by friendId, email, or friendCode
- `POST /api/friends/[friendshipId]/accept` - Accept request + create activity
- `POST /api/friends/[friendshipId]/decline` - Decline request
- `DELETE /api/friends/[friendshipId]` - Remove friend
- `GET /api/friends` - List friends and pending requests
- `POST /api/friends/search` - Search users by query
- `POST /api/friends/find-by-code` - Find by friend code

**Recipe Posts (7 endpoints):**

- `POST /api/posts` - Create post
- `GET /api/posts/[postId]` - Get post details
- `PUT /api/posts/[postId]` - Update post
- `DELETE /api/posts/[postId]` - Delete post
- `POST /api/posts/[postId]/like` - Toggle like
- `POST /api/posts/[postId]/comment` - Add comment
- `DELETE /api/posts/[postId]/comment/[commentId]` - Delete comment

**Feed (2 endpoints):**

- `GET /api/feed` - Get aggregated friends feed
- `GET /api/feed/user/[userId]` - Get user-specific feed

### Optional Phase 5: Photo Upload

- Vercel Blob integration for photo uploads
- `POST /api/upload/photo` endpoint
- Image validation (type, size)

---

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### To Resume Implementation:

1. **Create directory structure:**

```bash
cd /Users/edward/dev/personal-chef-next

# Friend endpoints
mkdir -p app/api/friends/send-request
mkdir -p app/api/friends/search
mkdir -p app/api/friends/find-by-code
mkdir -p app/api/friends/\[friendshipId\]/accept
mkdir -p app/api/friends/\[friendshipId\]/decline

# Post endpoints (some already exist)
mkdir -p app/api/posts
mkdir -p app/api/posts/\[postId\]/like
mkdir -p app/api/posts/\[postId\]/comment/\[commentId\]

# Feed endpoints
mkdir -p app/api/feed/user/\[userId\]
```

2. **Copy templates from `SOCIAL_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** into each `route.ts` file

3. **Test each endpoint** using cURL examples in the guide

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes for all endpoints

## 📊 Architecture Overview

### Data Flow

**Friend Request:**

```
User A → POST /api/friends/send-request
  ↓
friend-utils.sendFriendRequest()
  ↓
Prisma: Create Friendship (status: pending)
  ↓
Return friendship object
```

**Accept Friend:**

```
User B → POST /api/friends/{id}/accept
  ↓
friend-utils.acceptFriendRequest()
  ↓
Prisma: Update status to 'accepted'
  ↓
feed-utils.createFriendshipActivity() (private to User B)
  ↓
Return updated friendship
```

**Create Post:**

```
User → POST /api/posts
  ↓
post-utils.createPost()
  ↓
Prisma: Create RecipePost
  ↓
feed-utils.createFeedActivity(type: 'post')
  ↓
Return post object
```

**Get Feed:**

```
User → GET /api/feed
  ↓
friend-utils.getFriendIds() (get accepted friends)
  ↓
feed-utils.getFriendsFeed()
  ↓
Query FeedActivity for friends + own friend_added
  ↓
Enrich with post/recipe details
  ↓
Return paginated activities
```

### Privacy Model

- **Posts**: Only visible to friends (enforced in feed queries)
- **Friend Activities**: Only visible to friends
- **friend_added**: Only visible to the user who made the friend (not broadcast)
- **Comments/Likes**: Visible to anyone who can see the post
- **User Discovery**: Non-friends can search but not view activity

### Database Relationships

```
User
  ├── sessions (1:many)
  ├── profile (1:1)
  ├── recipes (1:many)
  ├── posts (1:many)
  ├── postLikes (1:many)
  ├── comments (1:many)
  └── activities (1:many)

Recipe
  └── posts (1:many)

RecipePost
  ├── user (many:1)
  ├── recipe (many:1)
  ├── likes (1:many)
  └── comments (1:many)

Friendship
  - userId + friendId (unique constraint)
  - Bidirectional queries needed

FeedActivity
  ├── user (many:1)
  ├── postId (optional reference)
  └── recipeId (optional reference)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Already Implemented:

- ✅ Friend request validation (can't friend yourself)
- ✅ Duplicate friendship prevention
- ✅ Authorization checks (only recipient can accept/decline)
- ✅ Privacy enforcement (friends-only feed)
- ✅ Ownership validation (only author can update/delete posts)
- ✅ friend_added activities private to user

### TODO for Production:

- [ ] Rate limiting on friend requests (prevent spam)
- [ ] Image upload validation and sanitization
- [ ] Profanity filter for comments
- [ ] Report/block functionality
- [ ] Notification system for friend requests

---

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing TODO:

- [ ] Send friend request by email
- [ ] Send friend request by friend code
- [ ] Accept friend request
- [ ] Decline friend request
- [ ] Remove friend
- [ ] Search for users
- [ ] Create post with rating
- [ ] Like/unlike post
- [ ] Comment on post
- [ ] Delete comment
- [ ] Get personal feed (shows friends' activities)
- [ ] Get user-specific feed (friend's profile)
- [ ] Verify privacy (can't see non-friend posts)
- [ ] Verify friend_added only shows in own feed
- [ ] Test pagination on feed

---

## 📦 Dependencies Installed

- ✅ `@paralleldrive/cuid2` - For generating unique friend codes

---

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Friend Code System**: Uses cuid2 for short, unique, shareable codes
2. **Feed Activities**: Polymorphic design (postId/recipeId optional) for flexibility
3. **Privacy**: friend_added activities filtered by userId === currentUserId
4. **Pagination**: Cursor-based using createdAt timestamps
5. **Cascading Deletes**: Proper onDelete: Cascade for data integrity
6. **Status Enum**: FriendshipStatus enum for type safety
7. **Bidirectional Friendships**: Single record, queried both ways

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement API endpoints** using templates in `SOCIAL_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
2. **Test endpoints** with provided cURL examples
3. **Update API_EXAMPLES.md** with social feature examples
4. **Optional: Add photo upload** (Vercel Blob integration)
5. **Optional: Add real-time notifications** (WebSocket or polling)
