# Parse Recipe Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Complete

A new API endpoint has been added to parse recipes from URLs using AI.

## New Endpoint

### POST /api/ai/parse-recipe

**Purpose:** Extract and parse recipe information from any cooking website URL

**Request:**

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.example.com/recipe/chocolate-chip-cookies"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "recipe": {
    "id": "recipe-uuid",
    "title": "Best Chocolate Chip Cookies",
    "description": "Soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies",
    "servings": 24,
    "totalMinutes": 30,
    "tags": ["dessert", "cookies", "baking"],
    "ingredients": [...],
    "steps": [...],
    "source": "pasted",
    "sourceUrl": "https://www.example.com/recipe/chocolate-chip-cookies",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-25T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "message": "Recipe parsed successfully"
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`app/api/ai/parse-recipe/route.ts`** (NEW)

   - Request validation with Zod (URL format)
   - Authentication required
   - Calls AI parsing utility
   - Stores parsed recipe in database
   - Returns structured recipe JSON

2. **`lib/ai-utils.ts`** (MODIFIED)

   - Added `PARSE_RECIPE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - AI prompt for recipe extraction
   - Added `parseRecipeFromUrl()` function:
     - Fetches HTML content from URL
     - Limits HTML size to 50KB to prevent token overflow
     - Uses GPT-4 with lower temperature (0.3) for accurate extraction
     - Parses structured recipe data from HTML
     - Error handling for fetch failures

3. **`API_EXAMPLES.md`** (MODIFIED)

   - Added complete documentation with cURL examples
   - Includes request/response examples
   - Usage notes and limitations

4. **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** (MODIFIED)

   - Added to AI Features section

5. **`BACKEND_README.md`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added to API endpoints list

## How It Works

1. **User submits URL** to recipe page (any cooking website)
2. **Backend fetches HTML** from the URL with proper User-Agent
3. **HTML is truncated** to 50KB if necessary to stay within token limits
4. **OpenAI GPT-4 analyzes** the HTML content
5. **AI extracts** structured recipe data:
   - Title and description
   - Ingredients with quantities and units
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Servings and cooking time
   - Relevant tags/categories
6. **Recipe is stored** in database with source="pasted"
7. **Response returned** with complete recipe object

## Features

- ✅ Works with most popular recipe websites
- ✅ AI-powered extraction (no hardcoded patterns)
- ✅ Automatic data structuring
- ✅ Stored in user's recipe collection
- ✅ Protected endpoint (requires auth)
- ✅ Request validation
- ✅ Error handling for invalid/inaccessible URLs
- ✅ Lower temperature for accuracy
- ✅ TODO comments for credit deduction

## Build Status

```
✓ TypeScript compilation: PASSED
✓ Next.js build: SUCCESSFUL
✓ New route generated: /api/ai/parse-recipe
✓ Total routes: 10 (was 9)
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Parse a recipe from URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/parse-recipe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10813/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/"
  }'
```

## Limitations

- URL must be publicly accessible (no authentication required)
- HTML content limited to 50KB
- Requires valid OpenAI API key
- Subject to OpenAI rate limits
- Some websites with complex JavaScript may not parse well

## Future Enhancements

- Add recipe image extraction
- Support for authentication-protected recipes
- Cache parsed recipes to avoid duplicate processing
- Support for recipe URLs from specific sites (optimized parsing)
- Batch URL parsing
- Recipe validation and cleanup

## Notes

- Recipe is saved with `source="pasted"` to distinguish from generated recipes
- Original URL is preserved in response (though not stored in DB currently)
- Uses GPT-4 turbo preview model for best results
- Lower temperature (0.3) ensures accurate extraction vs creative generation
- TODO comments added for future credit/token deduction
